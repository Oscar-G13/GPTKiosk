# GPTKiosk
GPT Kiosk will be an innovative retail solution that leverages the power of OpenAI's GPT-3 and 4 language models to provide customers with personalized recommendations and insights. The kiosk im designing will be an interactive and engaging platform that allows customers to have natural language conversations with an AI assistant, which can help them with finding the products or services that best match their needs.

If you've ever been at a retail store such as Walmart or Home Depot, you know that the employees there are almost never available. Per their own online complaints, they're over worked and under paid and exhausted. With GPT Kiosk, your customers can simply walk up to a fully customized kiosk and start chatting with the AI assistant, which can provide them with a wide range of information, such as product recommendations, reviews, comparisons, and more. The assistant is trained on a vast amount of data, which allows it to understand natural language queries and generate responses that are accurate, relevant, and helpful. And of course, your company data will also be integrated to provide a more customized experience.

The kiosk is designed to be easy to use and intuitive, with a user-friendly interface that guides customers through the conversation. The assistant is capable of following entire conversations and sentiment, making it ideal for busy retail environments.

GPT Kiosk is a game-changing technology that has the potential to transform the retail industry by providing customers with personalized recommendations and insights that are tailored to their unique needs and preferences. It is currently in the development phase and will be launching soon. 

Stay tuned for more updates and information on how you can get involved in this exciting project.
